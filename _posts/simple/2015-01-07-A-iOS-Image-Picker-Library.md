title: '[iOS] A Image Picker Library'
---

最近我自己弄了个iOS图片选择库，基于[https://github.com/pavankris/PKImagePickerDemo](https://github.com/pavankris/PKImagePickerDemo)。

我在上面添加了图片旋转，缩放和裁剪这样几个常用的功能。

Recently, I created a iOS image picker library, based on [https://github.com/pavankris/PKImagePickerDemo](https://github.com/pavankris/PKImagePickerDemo).

I added some image editing functions to it, which I think is quite useful.
