title:  "Try MS Exchange Online"
---

For a long time, I have prejudice of services provided by `Microsoft`.

So, this time, for email system on private domain, I decide to use `MS Exchange Online`

The configuration process is very `Microsoft-style`. 

When I opened the dashboard, I saw tens of page entries, which mean hundreds of configurable items are waiting for me.

Of cause, make it work is definitely quick and simple, but it also provides tons of options for advanced configurations, and all of them do make sense.

Complex and reliable, this is my conclusion.
